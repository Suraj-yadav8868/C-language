## Question 1: Average and Grade of a Student

**What is the question?**
Write a C program to calculate the average marks of a student considering **5 subjects**, where each subject is out of 100 marks. Based on the average marks, evaluate and display the **grade** using conditional statements.

**What the program does:**

* Takes marks of 5 subjects as input
* Calculates total and average marks
* Uses `if-else` conditions to decide the grade (A, B, C, D, or Fail)

## Question 2: Average of Elements in a 2D Array Using Function

**What is the question?**
Write a C program to find the **average of all elements** present in a **2D array** using a **user-defined function**.

**What the program does:**

* Accepts elements of a 3x3 matrix
* Passes the 2D array to a function
* The function calculates the sum and average of all elements
* Displays the average value

## Question 3: Print Odd Elements from a 1D Array Using Function

**What is the question?**
Write a C program that defines a function to print **only odd elements** from a **1D array**.

**What the program does:**

* Takes elements of a 1D array from the user
* Passes the array to a function
* The function checks each element
* Prints only the odd numbers

## Question 4: Find Even Elements from 1D Array Using Pointer

**What is the question?**
Write a C program to find and display **even elements** from a **1D array using pointers**.

**What the program does:**

* Accepts array elements from the user
* Uses a pointer to access array elements
* Checks each element using pointer arithmetic
* Prints only even numbers

## Question 5: Pattern Printing Using Nested For Loop

**What is the question?**
Write a C program to print a **number pattern** using **nested for loops**, where blank spaces are used before numbers to form a right-aligned structure.

**What the program does:**

* Uses nested loops
* First loop controls rows
* Inner loops handle spaces and numbers
* Prints the required pattern line by line
